# tsa_scrape
This R script scrapes US Transportation Security Administration daily screening data for context on pandemic air travel recovery. The script creates a local copy of the 
passenger screening data for future comparisons and in case the TSA data goes offline. The script then generates three graphs and some calculations for context about the
most recent data.
